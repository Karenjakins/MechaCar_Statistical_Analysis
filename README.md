# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

Statistical study using **R** to compare vehicle performance.

## Overview of the analysis: 

The following study contains three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal presented as follows::

1. Deliverable 1: **Linear Regression to Predict MPG**
2. Deliverable 2: **Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils**
3. Deliverable 3: **T-Test on Suspension Coils**
4. Deliverable 4: **Design Proposal** a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. **August Peak Hours**

- We desigend a linear model that predicts the **mpg** of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the `MechaCar_mpg.csv` and the resulting model can be viewed on the image below:

	**SUMMARY**

	From the results above:

	* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

	* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

	* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

2. **Top Ending Locations**

	For a bike renting business to be effective there needs to be a clear understanding of areas within cities that have higher demand and where most of the bikes need to be allocated to ensure there is enough supply. The above visualization shows the **top ending locations** in NYC which reflects where the majority of the bikes were taken when they were checked out by the users. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

3. **Checkout Times for Users** 

	![alt text](URL "Deliverable 1")

	The above line graph shows the **average time** a bike was checked out by the users, which can be useful to offer fair pricing and ideal rental time slots for the bikes.

4. **Checkout Times by Gender**

	![alt text](URL "Deliverable 1")

	The above graphic is a more detailed look into the checkout times, and it looks into **gender**, which can be useful to understand trends and how to cater to all demographics and perhaps offer bikes that can meet the needs of different users. 


## Summary 

This data analysis provides insightful information for investors into the demand for bike renting businesses in New York which can be implemented in cities like Des Moines. It's clear there is a high demand for bikes, regardless of gender and it appears to be a popular method of transportation be it for day-to-day needs to more touristic uses.

Based on the data set provided, I would have conducted an analysis of hours where bikes were used the least, to plan out the most ideal time slots for maintenance of the bikes across the stations to ensure bikes are always ready to be checked out without inconveniencing users and customers.

Another analysis that can be useful to conduct would be to take into consideration the distances transited by users, and with this information try to set up a more efficient plan for stations that allow for more reachability for all commutes.
